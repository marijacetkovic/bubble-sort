# Bubble Sort Algorithm Simulation in Assembler 

Project done in an 16-bit Assembler Simulator (https://e.famnit.upr.si/pluginfile.php/696726/mod_resource/content/1/index.html). Animating the bubble sort algorithm using the simulator. If you would like to run it, copy the code into the Simulator, assemble it, set the speed 10KHz and run.

You are welcome to enjoy the demo of the simulator below.
